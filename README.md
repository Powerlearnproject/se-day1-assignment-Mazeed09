#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Ans:Software engineering is the application of engineering principles and techniques to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software systems. It is a systematic approach to software development that ensures the delivery of high-quality software products.

Ans:Ensures high-quality software that meets user requirements.
 -Reduces development costs by following structured methodologies.
- Enhances security and reliability, preventing system failures.
- Enables scalability to support growing user demands.
- Supports collaboration through development frameworks and version control.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1 1950s-1960s – Birth of Programming & Structured Software Development
   - Early computers used machine language and assembly.
   - Introduction of COBOL and FORTRAN.

2. 1970s-1980s – Introduction of Software Development Methodologies
   - The Waterfall Model emerged.
   - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) was introduced (e.g., Smalltalk, C++).

3. 1990s-Present – Agile Development & AI-Powered Software Engineering
   - The Agile Manifesto (2001) revolutionized software engineering.
   - DevOps & CI/CD pipelines streamlined software deployment.
   - AI and ML are enhancing automated code generation, testing, and debugging.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The phases of the SDLC are:

1. Requirements Gathering: Identifying and documenting software requirements.
2. Design: Creating a detailed design of the software system.
3. Implementation: Writing the code for the software system.
4. Testing: Verifying that the software system meets the requirements.
5. Deployment: Delivering the software system to the end-users.
6. Maintenance: Updating and fixing the software system over time.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall:
Ans:
- Advantages: Easy to manage, predictable timeline and budget.
- Disadvantages: Inflexible, high risk of project failure.

Agile:

- Advantages: Flexible, iterative, and incremental.
- Disadvantages: Requires high team collaboration, can be challenging to manage.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Ans:
- Software Developer: Designs, develops, and tests software systems.
- Quality Assurance Engineer: Verifies that software systems meet the requirements.
- Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Ans:
- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Provide a comprehensive development environment for software developers.
- Version Control Systems (VCS): Enable multiple developers to collaborate on software projects.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Ans:

- Technical Debt: The accumulation of technical issues that need to be addressed.
- Communication Breakdown: Ineffective communication among team members.
- Time Constraints: Meeting project deadlines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Ans:
- Unit Testing: Verifying individual software components.
- Integration Testing: Verifying interactions between software components.
- System Testing: Verifying the entire software system.
- Acceptance Testing: Verifying that the software system meets the requirements.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Ans:Prompt engineering is the process of designing and optimizing text prompts to elicit specific responses from AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Ans:
Vague Prompt: "Write a story about a character who learns something new."

Improved Prompt: "Write a 500-word story about a 25-year-old software engineer who learns to play the guitar and discovers a new passion. Include a scene where they perform in front of an audience."

The improved prompt is more effective because it provides specific details about the character, plot, and tone, making it easier for the AI model to generate a relevant and coherent response.
